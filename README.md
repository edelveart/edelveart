### About me
_Mathematics empowers creative computing and art._ <br>

I design inventive systems that make math concepts from arithmetic geometry and discrete structures interactive for live coders, musicians, and inquisitive minds.

### Bridges Between Worlds
These libraries are my answer to a wild and fascinating question:

    What if some elegant ideas, ranging from Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem to the Langlands program, 
    could become instruments for creating music, writing code, and dancing with math?
    And what if music, in turn, could inspire unexpected new math?
    
I'm currently working on the following projects:

- [modular_forms](https://rubygems.org/gems/modular_forms): A creative **math engine** that makes modular forms and elliptic curves interactive, musical, and live. Built with Ruby/Sonic Pi, this project transforms deep arithmetic geometry into a playground for code and sound. Inspired in **LMFDB**, **SageMath**, **Pari/GP**. 
- [ts-tonnetz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-tonnetz): a TypeScript math library for **transformational music theory**: graphs, cycles, group actions. It is currently implemented in [**Topos**](https://topos.live/), a live-coding environment where music theory becomes code you can jam with.
- [figuratenum](https://pypi.org/project/figuratenum/): a Python library that generates `235` infinite sequences of **multidimensional figurate numbers**. I'm also maintaining a Ruby version, [**figurate_numbers**](https://rubygems.org/gems/figurate_numbers), with similar functionality. Both are designed for use in **pure mathematics**, **algorithmic composition**, and **live coding** contexts.

<!--PS: I am not a mathematician or a programmer, so the code and ideas that you can find here are mostly my best effort at abstraction.-->

### Skills
- TypeScript, Node, Express, SQL, Git (primarily server-side)
- Some knowledge of Ruby and Python
