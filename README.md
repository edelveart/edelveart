### About me

I design creative systems that integrate mathematical structures with computational tools for live coders, musicians, and curious minds.

I currently develop **modular_forms** (inspired by SageMath and LMFDB) and **ts-tonnetz**, packages for real-time algorithmic composition. My libraries for generating **figurate numbers** have surpassed **17,000** downloads.

I have published an article indexed in Scopus on Mathematical Music Theory, teach at the graduate level, and contribute to international open-source projects.

These libraries are my answer to a wild and fascinating question:

    What if some elegant mathematical ideas could become instruments 
    for creating music, writing code, and dancing with math?
    And what if music, in turn, could inspire unexpected new math?
    
### Libraries

- [modular_forms](https://rubygems.org/gems/modular_forms): A creative **math engine** that makes modular forms and elliptic curves interactive, musical, and live. Built with Ruby/Sonic Pi, this project transforms some concepts from arithmetic geometry into a playground for code and sound. Inspired in **LMFDB**, **SageMath**, **Pari/GP**. 
- [ts-tonnetz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-tonnetz): a TypeScript math library for **transformational music theory**: graphs, cycles, group actions. It is currently implemented in [**Topos**](https://topos.live/), a live-coding environment where music theory becomes code you can jam with.
- [figuratenum](https://pypi.org/project/figuratenum/): a Python library that generates `235` infinite sequences of **multidimensional figurate numbers**. I'm also maintaining a Ruby version, [**figurate_numbers**](https://rubygems.org/gems/figurate_numbers), with similar functionality. Both are designed for use in **pure mathematics**, **algorithmic composition**, and **live coding** contexts.

:eye: Assist in the integration of new artistic and math concepts in your musical and computer projects. 

<!--PS: I am not a mathematician or a programmer, so the code and ideas that you can find here are mostly my best effort at abstraction.-->

### Skills
- TypeScript, Node, Express, SQL, Git (primarily server-side)
- Some knowledge of Ruby and Python
